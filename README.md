Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.13 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

This is a fork of the official Terraform Provider for Gitlab, with additional changes from Claranet.

Most notably, this fork:

- includes not yet released changes from the official provider.
- adds the `gitlab_group_members` resource.
- has its `master` branch on par with the upstream `master`, with no additional changes.
- has its default branch set to `claranet`, which is where custom development happens.

Unofficial tags made by Claranet are suffixed `-claranet`, and eventually an increment.
They are based on the most recent upstream tag name on which the `claranet` branch was last rebased.

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-gitlab`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-gitlab
$ cd terraform-provider-gitlab
$ git remote rename origin upstream
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:claranet/terraform-provider-gitlab
```

Note: this is done in that order so that master tracks the upstream one.

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-gitlab
$ make build
```

Rebasing The Provider
---------------------

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-gitlab
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git push origin master
$ git checkout claranet
$ git rebase upstream/master
```


Using the provider
----------------------
## Fill in for each provider

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-gitlab
...
```

### Running tests
The Terraform Provider only has acceptance tests, these can run against a gitlab instance where you have a token with administrator permissions (likely not gitlab.com). 
There is excellent documentation on [how to run gitlab from docker at gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/docker/)

In order to run the full suite of acceptance tests, export the environment variables: 

- `GITLAB_TOKEN` //token for account with admin priviliges
- `GITLAB_BASE_URL` //URL with api part e.g. `http://localhost:8929/api/v4/`

and run `make testacc`.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
